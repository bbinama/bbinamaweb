I am a passionate plant ecologist with a knack for diving into data-driven solutions. My journey in biological sciences has taken me from exploring the biodiversity of tropical forests in Rwanda to plant population genetics and unraveling the complexities of invasive plant species in Central Europe. Currently, I am independent researcher on a mission to integrate ecology with state-of-the-art data science methodologies.
